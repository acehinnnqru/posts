title: "monologue: just stay alone"
---

for a long time, I think I am a kind person and may make many good friends.

When I realized that it's always me who actively tries to talk and play with them, I was so so so so sad. Why? It's because I'm the one who is more lonely or kind? Or that I am too boring?

But why everybody could talk actively in groups but won't share something with me? Yeah, people always being in lots of groups and I was like to be alone. But I am kind to them and I think we are or were good friends.

Is there I did something wrong? Or just my friends got their stuff and I just the lower-priorities one?

Just be alone and wait for someone who would like to make friends with you sincerely.
